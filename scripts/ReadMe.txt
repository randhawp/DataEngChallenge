About the solution

Lang: Python 2.7
Platform: Zeppelin 0.7
Architecture: Standalone Execution Mode On a single instance of M4.Large EC2 

Solution organization:
There are 3 parts to the solution as required
(a) Data exploration does a statistical review of the data based on hourly breakdown
(b) GeoHash - investigates the clustering of data based on a city level geography
(c) Research - looks at trends in data ingestion which may help in elastically scaling up/down the compute resources


Further Work
More analysis on the data can be done.
